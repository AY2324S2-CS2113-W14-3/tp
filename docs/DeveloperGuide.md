## Architecture

![Architecture](diagrams/Architecture.png)

Below is an elaborate description of the UML diagram that outlines the structure and relationships of Architecture:

#### **Classes Involved:**
- **`FAP`**: The central class that initializes and coordinates the various components of the application.
- **`ModuleList`**: Manages a collection of academic modules.
- **`Ui`**: Facilitates all user interactions through a command-line interface.
- **`Parser`**: Interprets user input into executable commands.
- **`Command`**: Implements the logic necessary for executing commands identified by the `Parser`.
- **`User`**: Contains details about the user and their current semester.
- **`JsonManager`**: Handles operations related to reading from and writing to JSON files.
- **`Storage`**: Manages data storage and retrieval operations.

#### **Associations:**
- **`FAP`** has associations with:
    - **`ModuleList`** for managing academic modules.
    - **`Ui`** for handling inputs and outputs to and from the user.
    - **`Parser`** for converting user input into commands.
    - **`Command`** for executing actions based on user commands.
    - **`JsonManager`** and **`Storage`** for data persistence functionalities.

#### **Flow and Interactions:**
- The diagram centers on **`FAP`**, highlighting its role as the orchestrator for the applicationâ€™s operations.
- It illustrates **`FAP`**'s interactions with components like **`Ui`**, **`Parser`**, **`JsonManager`**, and **`Storage`**, emphasizing a structured and controlled flow of operations.

This narrative emphasizes the `FAP` class's critical role in integrating the application's functionalities, showcasing its design focused on modularity, maintainability, and extensibility.

### Running the Application Loop

The `runApplication` method encapsulates the application's runtime loop, processing user commands until an exit condition is met (either through an error or the 'bye' command). This method highlights the application of polymorphism (via the `Command` class) and encapsulation, detailing interactions with other components.

```java
private static void runApplication() {
    Ui ui = new Ui();
    boolean continueRunning = true;

    while (continueRunning) {
        try {
            String userInput = ui.getUserCommand();
            LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "User input: " + userInput);
            Command command = Parser.getCommand(userInput);
            command.execute(userInput);
            user.resetModuleStatuses();
            saveModulesToFile(filePath);
            if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase(BYE)) {
                continueRunning = false;
                ui.close();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "An error occurred: " + e.getMessage(), e);
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
            ui.close();
            continueRunning = false;  // Exit loop on error
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Key Points:**

- **Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error management that logs severe issues and terminates the application loop appropriately.
- **Command Processing**: It continuously processes commands through a loop that persists until 'bye' is entered or an exception is thrown, using polymorphic `Command` objects for executing a variety of actions.
- **Resource Management**: Ensures all resources are appropriately closed upon exiting the loop, reflecting prudent resource management practices (e.g., closing `Ui`).

This method is instrumental in understanding the dynamic interactions and procedural flow within the `FAP` application, highlighting the effective use of OOP principles like polymorphism and encapsulation to manage complex behaviors and state transitions efficiently.

### Overview

The application follows a layered architecture, with distinct components responsible for user interaction, data, 
storage, and logic. This design promotes modularity, maintainability, and extensibility, allowing for easy integration 
of new features and enhancements.

### Main Class: `FAP`

The `FAP` class serves as the central hub of the application, orchestrating the flow of execution and managing critical
resources. It embodies key software design principles and showcases thoughtful architectural decisions.

#### Design Overview

- **Singleton Components:** `FAP` manages singleton components such as `moduleList` and `LOGGER`, ensuring they are
  initialized once and accessible throughout the application's lifecycle.
    - `ModuleList`: A collection that holds modules, initialized with a capacity of 10.
    - `LOGGER`: Utilized for logging various levels of application events and errors.

- **Separation of Concerns:** The class delegates specific responsibilities to specialized classes, adhering to the
  principle of separation of concerns.
    - Interaction with users is managed by the `Ui` class.
    - Command parsing is delegated to the `Parser` class.
    - Command execution is handled by implementations of the `Command` interface.

- **Error Handling:** Demonstrates robust error handling strategies by catching and logging different exceptions, which
  ensures graceful handling of unexpected situations.

## Design

### UI

### User class
**Code** : [`User.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/user/User.java)

The `User` class carries general information about the user of FAP.
As of `v2.1`, the user class is limited in functionality and only contain information about the user's
1. `name`
2. `current semester` of study

The `User` class is mainly utilized by SetCommand and ViewCommand through its getter and setter methods.

The main purpose of the `User` class is to introduce a basic level of personalization by allowing users to input and 
store their personal information. This information will be shown to the users through `Ui` class 
methods such as `printUserInfo()` and `printGreeting()`.

Additionally, the `User` class helps to verify the status of the modules in the user's plan, determining whether the 
modules have been taken or not.

### Parser package
**Code**: 
- [`Parser.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/parser/Parser.java) 
- [`CommandMetadata.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/parser/CommandMetadata.java)

The `Parser` class, together with the `CommandMetadata` class parses user input to
**return appropriate command objects** for the corresponding `Command` classes. If input validation fails or no
matching command is found, it returns an `Invalid` command instance.

**Overview:**

Below is a class diagram that shows the associations between `Parser` and `CommandMetadata`

![ParserClassDiagram.png](diagrams/ParserClassDiagram.png)

The`CommandMetadata` class is an abstract class that manages regular expressions (regex) and validation
for command arguments, allowing subclasses to generate specific **`Command` instances** based on **command keywords
and parsed arguments.** For every `Command` class, there would be a corresponding `CommandMetadata` class (with the 
exception of `Invalid` command) that overrides the method `createCommandInstance` to generate the `Command` instance of
the specific `Command`.

The `Parser` class maintains a list of these `CommandMetadata` subclasses instances and iterates through them to
identify a given user command.

Further implementation details are available at "Parsing User Inputs" section under Implementation.

**How it works (Sequence):**

Below is a sequence diagram that shows how the `FAP` main method calls `Parser` to parse a `userInput` 
for a `Command` to return:

![ParserSequenceDiagram.png](diagrams/ParserSequenceDiagram.png)

The method to parse and validate user inputs is handled in the `Parser` method `getCommand(String userInput)`:
1. `userInput` is first checked to see if it is null or empty. If either condition is met, `Parser` returns an 'Invalid' 
command instance.
2. The first `word` of the `userInput` string is then checked to see if it matches with a valid command 
`keyword` (Eg. `add`, `remove`, `view` etc)
3. If there is no match, return an `Invalid` command instance (on loop end)
4. If there is a match, the corresponding `CommandMetadata` class for the `keyword` is called upon, 
and there will be a further attempt to match the `userInput` string with the command `regex` expression
5. If it does not match, the `CommandMetadata` class will validate the error in user string syntax, print out 
an error message, and return an `Invalid` command instance
6. If it matches, the command `arguments` will be extracted out and the respective command class instance will be
created based on the overwritten method `createCommandInstance` in the respective `CommandMetadata` class

### Storage

### Module, Module List, JSON

### Command

Here's how the `Command` class interact with the other classes:

![Command diagram](diagrams/Command-0.png)

How the `Command` component works (together with other classes):

1. When the user's input is received in `FAP.java`, it is passed into the `Parser` class which then creates an instance
   of the `Command` object.
2. The object would be a specific implementation of the `Command` class (i.e. `AddCommand`, `ViewCommand`, etc.)
3. The specific `Command` subclass would then be present in `FAP.java` as a new `Command` object
4. `execute()` is then called on the object to perform its task.

## Implementation

### Classes / Package

**Parsing User Inputs**

**Use of regular expressions (Regex) in FAP:**

The add command class requires a user input that best matches this string
```
add c/COURSECODE w/SEMESTERTAKEN
```
where `COURSECODE` and `SEMESTERTAKEN` have their defined restrictions: `COURSECODE` should best match an actual
course code at NUS, `SEMESTERTAKEN` should be a number value in some range. The `COURSECODE` and `SEMESTERTAKEN`
will thus have their own argument regex pattern.

A simple regex example would be that `SEMESTERTAKEN` would be a number ranging from 1-8 to represent a normal honours
pathway for a CEG student (FAP's target user). A regex pattern for that could look like `w/(?<semester>[1-8])` (In this 
case, `w/` is used as a `delimitter` but it is not **strictly** neccessary **unless** the `regex` have special 
conditions such as allowing whitespaces). An **argument name capturing group** `semester` is enclosed within the 
brackets so that the argument group will be **named** and thus the argument value (anywhere between `1-8`) can be 
referenced/called and retrieved by using the `Matcher` method `group()` with the argument `"semester"`.
Meanwhile, the java utility classes `Pattern` and `Matcher` would handle the checks that the argument value given
is indeed between `1-8`.

A userInput regex for FAP would thus follow this convention:
```
keyword argument_1 argument_2 ...
```
This full regex pattern for a command itself can be generated by having a `keyword`, as well as all the
argument `group names` (a name to use so as to _reference_ the argument) and the argument `regex` pattern
corresponding to that name reference. Typically, these arguments should be spaced out and thus a `\s+` (representing
at least one whitespace character) is placed between the gaps of the regex pattern for
`keyword, argument_1, argument_2...`

While regex allows the `userInput` checks to be prudent, as well as potentially offering the flexibility for string
inputs to allow a different order of arguments, there are limitations where it becomes hard to determine the exact
error of the user's input solely based on the regular expressions, because it solely returns a true/false value
if the string value itself fits the `regex` criteria given). Regardless, we think the use of regex in FAP can help provide
us **safety in the arguments** that passes through to the commands via the userInput.

**Developer usage FAP: Parser & CommandMetadata class as of `v2.1`**: **How to create a new command**

- First, we need a `Command` type class to return as an object. In the future, this may be expanded to any `T` type.
- Second, we need a string that would be used to create this `Command` instance. This string should follow the
  format `keyword argument_1 argument_2...` where the `keyword` is mandatory, `argument_1, argument_2...` 
  are **optional**.
- Third, for every argument available, make a **regex pattern with name capturing** that encloses the value within the
  brackets. (e.g., `n/(?<name>[A-Za-z0-9 ]+)`, `g/(?<grade>[ab][+-]?|[cd][+]?|f|cs)`)

**Using example `add c/COURSECODE w/SEMESTERTAKEN`**
- Create a subclass that extends `CommandMetadata`.
- Put in the `keyword` (e.g., `add`) and `groupArgumentNames` (e.g., `{"courseCode", "semester"}`) in the superclass
  constructor.
- Define the argument regex pattern in the static variable `argsRegexMap` with the corresponding `groupArgumentName` and 
argument `regex` pattern. 
  - Note: Currently `argsRegexMap` is in the superclass `CommandMetadata` 
  (e.g., `argRegexMap.put("semester", "w/(?<semester>[1-8])")`).
- Override the method `createCommandInstance(Map<String, String> args)` to implement the method on how to create
  the `Command` object you want. Return the `Command` instance.
    - Note: `Map<String, String> args` contains the `groupArgumentName : argumentValue` pairing.
- In the `Parser` class, add the created `CommandMetadata` subclass to `metadataList`.
- The `Parser` method `getCommand(String userInput)` will help validate the `userInput`. If the `userInput` matches
  the string you wanted, then `getCommand(String userInput)` will return the Command instance you require.

Sample `CommandMetadata` example code:
```java
public class AddCommandMetadata extends CommandMetadata {
private static final String ADD_KEYWORD = "add";
private static final String[] ADD_ARGUMENTS = {"courseCode", "semester"};

public AddCommandMetadata() {
    super(ADD_KEYWORD, ADD_ARGUMENTS);
}

// Add Command Creator
@Override
protected Command createCommandInstance(Map<String, String> args) {
    String moduleCode = args.getOrDefault("courseCode", "COURSECODE_ERROR");
    String semester = args.getOrDefault("semester", "SEMESTER_ERROR");
    int semesterInt = Integer.parseInt(semester);
    
    return new AddCommand(moduleCode, semesterInt);
}
```

`v2.1`: **Optional** regex arguments is now supported (eg. `userInput` regex expressions `view` and `view c/COURSECODE` 
can now be both valid). This feature is still under testing.

**Here is an extended developer usage guide:**
- For every argument that can be optional, a new `String[]` has been introduced. This String[] should match the 
length of the regular `String[]` containing the argument names. Each element in this new array should indicate whether 
the corresponding argument is optional or mandatory. For instance, if `courseCode` is mandatory, and `semester` is 
optional:

```java
private static final String[] ADD_ARGUMENTS = {"courseCode", "semester"};
private static final String[] ADD_ARG_FLAGS = {"mandatory", "optional"};
```

- Put the new `String[]` inside the superclass constructor, an example is as follows:

```java
public AddCommandMetadata() {
    super(ADD_KEYWORD, ADD_ARGUMENTS, ADD_ARG_FLAGS);
}
```

- Otherwise, if all argument `regex` is mandatory, there is no need to include it in the superclass constructor:

```java
public AddCommandMetadata() {
    super(ADD_KEYWORD, ADD_ARGUMENTS);
}
```

### Saving modules to file

The `Storage` class is responsible for managing the persistence of user and module data to and from files. This document section focuses on the `saveModulesToFile` method, which saves the current user's information and their module list to a specified file path.

#### Method: `saveModulesToFile`

```java
public static void saveModulesToFile(String filePath) throws StorageException {
    try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) {
        writer.write(toString(user) + System.lineSeparator());
        for (Module module : moduleList.getTakenModuleList()) {
            writer.write(toString(module) + System.lineSeparator());
        }
    } catch (IOException | SecurityException e) {
        throw new StorageException("An error occurred while saving modules to file: " + filePath);
    }
}
```

#### Parameters:
- `filePath` - The path of the file where the data is to be saved.

#### Throws:
- `StorageException` - if an error occurs during the file writing process.

#### Process Description:

1. **File Writing Setup**:
    - Initializes a `BufferedWriter` wrapped around a `FileWriter` to write text to the file efficiently. 
    This setup benefits from buffered writing, which minimizes the number of physical disk writes.

2. **Writing User Data**:
    - The user's data is converted to a string format and written to the file first, followed by a 
    newline character to separate entries clearly.

3. **Writing Modules Data**:
    - Iterates over the list of taken modules (`moduleList.getTakenModuleList()`), converting each module 
    to a string format and writing it to the file. Each module entry is written on a new line.

4. **Resource Management**:
    - The `BufferedWriter` is declared within a try-with-resources statement, ensuring that it is closed at 
    the end of the statement block, regardless of whether the operation completes successfully or fails.

#### Error Handling:
- Catches `IOException` and `SecurityException`, throwing a `StorageException` with a message detailing the failure. 
    This encapsulation of exceptions provides a clear API for the method, simplifying error handling for the caller.

### UML Sequence Diagram Explanation

Below is the UML sequence diagram for the `saveModulesToFile` method, illustrating the interactions 
between components during the file-saving process.

![StorageSequenceDiagram.png](diagrams/StorageSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Steps Illustrated in the Diagram:

1. **Main Initiates Save**:
    - The `FAP` class (or the main method) calls `saveModulesToFile`, passing the file path where 
    data needs to be saved.

2. **Storage Operations**:
    - **Directory Check**: Verifies or creates the necessary directory.
    - **File Writer Setup**: Sets up the `BufferedWriter` and `FileWriter`.
    - **Data Writing**:
        - Writes user data.
        - Iteratively writes data for each module in the `ModuleList`.

3. **Completion**:
    - Once all data is written, the `BufferedWriter` is closed (implicitly by the try-with-resources), 
    which also flushes the buffer to the file, finalizing the write operation.

#### Conclusion:
This sequence diagram and the corresponding detailed explanation provide a clear, step-by-step guide 
to the `saveModulesToFile` method's operations, highlighting how data integrity and error handling are maintained.

### Commands

#### View Commands

User input is passed to `Parser.getCommand()`, which determines that the input contains the keyword `view`, which
branches out depending on whether it is followed by a `c/COURSE_CODE` (refer to the `Parser` implementation
on how it detects optional inputs).

- #### View Schedule (without `c/COURSE_CODE`)

1. Calls `ModuleList.getModuleMySemester()`.
2. Subsequently, calls `Ui.java`'s `printScheduleHeader()`, `printModulePlan()`, and `printScheduleDetails()`.

- #### View Specific Course Information (with `c/COURSE_CODE`)

1. Checks if the course exists in NUS AY23/24 by calling `JsonManager.moduleExist()`.
2. In the event the method returns `false`, else it
   calls `JsonManager.queryModuleInfo()` to get the module's relevant details (i.e. course title, MCs and description).
3. It prints out a statement stating the module does not exist if point 1. returns false, else it prints out the
   module information.

The following diagram illustrates how the `ViewCommand` operates when `execute()` is called:

![ViewCommand Sequence Diagram](diagrams/ViewCommand-0.png)

- #### View Courses Needed to Graduate
  This feature is implemented under the `ViewGraduateCommand` instead of the previous `ViewCommand` as it is invoked
  under a different keyword (i.e. `graduate`).

1. User input is passed into `Parser.getCommand()`, it returns an instance of `ViewGraduateCommand` and `FAP.java` will
   call its `execute()` method.
2. It gets the modules left to complete by `ModuleList.getModulesToComplete()` which loops over all the modules in the
   user's `ModuleList` and checks it against `CEGModules` to see if it is a valid CEG Module, or if its equivalent
   exists (e.g. CP3880 and EG3611A).
3. If the exact module is found in `CEGModules`, the module and its equivalent will not be added to
   the `modulesToComplete`.
4. `printModulesToComplete()` is called and prints out the required modules based on the `modulesToComplete`.

The following diagram illustrates how `ViewGraduateCommand` operates when its `execute()` method is called:

![ViewGraduateCommand Sequence Diagram](diagrams/ViewGraduateCommand-0.png)

1. **Application Initialization and Entry Point:**

   The `main` method, as the application's entry point, performs initial setups such as greeting the user and ensuring
   critical components are initialized properly. It encapsulates high-level flow control and implements error handling
   to manage assertion errors and unexpected exceptions.

   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       try {
           printGreeting();
           assert moduleList != null : "moduleList should not be null";
           runApplication();
       } catch (AssertionError e) {
           LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Assertion failed: " + e.getMessage(), e);
           System.err.println("Critical assertion failure: " + e.getMessage());
       } catch (Exception e) {
           LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "An unexpected error occurred: " + e.getMessage(), e);
           System.err.println("An unexpected error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
       }
   }
   ```

### UML Diagram Description


3. **Module Class:**

   #### Purpose

   Represents an academic module, holding information such as the module code, credits (MCs), grade, and description.

   #### Key Methods

    - **`setModuleGrade(String moduleGrade)`**  
      Sets the grade for the module. Validates the grade format and throws `ModuleException` if the module hasn't been
      taken yet.

    - **`getGradeNumber()`**  
      Returns a numerical value associated with the module's grade, used for GPA calculation.

4. **ModuleList Class:**

   #### Purpose

   Manages a collection of `Module` objects. It facilitates operations such as adding, removing, retrieving modules,
   calculating GPA, and grouping modules by semester.

   #### Key Methods

    - **`addModule(Module module)`**  
      Adds a new module to the list.  
      Throws `IllegalArgumentException` if the module is `null`.

    - **`getModule(String courseCode)`**  
      Retrieves a module by its course code.  
      Throws `ModuleNotFoundException` if the module is not found.

      Changes the grade of a module identified by its course code.

    - **`tallyGPA()`**  
      Calculates and returns the GPA based on the modules in the list.  
      Throws `GpaNullException` if there are no modules with countable grades.

    - **`groupModulesBySemester()`**  
      Groups modules by their semester and returns a map where each key is a semester, and each value is a list of
      modules in that semester.

   #### Error Handling

   Uses exceptions to handle errors, such as when trying to access or modify modules that don't exist.

5. **Getting module details from Json File (JsonManager Class):**

   #### Overview

   The `JsonManager` class is designed to manage and interact with module information stored in a JSON format. It
   provides functionalities for checking the existence of modules, retrieving module information such as Modular
   Credits (MCs), description, and title from a JSON file.

   #### Constructor

    - `JsonManager()`: Initializes a new instance of the `JsonManager` by loading the module information from a JSON
      file located at `/moduleInfo.json`.

   #### Methods

   ##### Module Existence

    - **`moduleExist(String moduleCode)`**: Checks if a module with the specified code exists in the JSON data.
        - **Parameters**: `String moduleCode` - The code of the module to check for existence.
        - **Returns**: `boolean` - `true` if the module exists, `false` otherwise.

   ##### Module Information Retrieval

    - **`getModuleInfo(String moduleCode)`**: Retrieves detailed information about a module, including its Modular
      Credits, description, and title, based on the module code.
        - **Parameters**: `String moduleCode` - The code of the module for which information is to be retrieved.
        - **Note**: This method updates the internal state of the `JsonManager` object with the retrieved module
          information.

   ##### Information Accessors

    - **`getModuleDescription()`**: Returns the description of the last module queried.
        - **Returns**: `String` - The description of the module.

    - **`getModuleMC()`**: Returns the Modular Credits of the last module queried.
        - **Returns**: `int` - The Modular Credits of the module.

    - **`getModuleTitle()`**: Returns the title of the last module queried.
        - **Returns**: `String` - The title of the module.

   #### Error Handling

    - The constructor throws a `RuntimeException` if the JSON file containing module information cannot be found or
      accessed, ensuring that the application is aware of missing or inaccessible module data.

   #### Usage

   ```java
   JsonManager jsonManager = new JsonManager();
   if (jsonManager.moduleExist("CS1010")) {
       jsonManager.getModuleInfo("CS1010");
       System.out.println("Module Title: " + jsonManager.getModuleTitle());
       System.out.println("Module Description: " + jsonManager.getModuleDescription());
       System.out.println("Module MC: " + jsonManager.getModuleMC());
   }
   ```

6. **Viewing GPA**

   The `ViewGpaCommand` class is responsible for displaying the current GPA attained by the student. It
   accesses `ModuleList`, which looks through all `Module` object contained in the list. If the `Module` is marked as
   taken and has been assigned a valid grade with `GradeCommand` by the user, its grades will be included into the
   calculation.

   This is the formula used for tabulation of GPA.
   `GPA = SUM(Course Grade Point * Course Units) / SUM(Course Units Counted Towards GPA)`

   Below is the sequence diagram for `ViewGpaCommand`.
   ![View Gpa Command Sequence Diagram](diagrams/ViewGpaCommand.png)

Design & Implementation
Storage Class

The Storage class is crucial for persisting user data between sessions, ensuring that module information and user
preferences are not lost even after the application is closed. It interacts with the file system to load and save data,
employing error handling to manage potential IO exceptions gracefully.
Key Responsibilities

- **File Management:** Ensures necessary directories and files exist at application startup or creates them if they
  don't.
- **Data Persistence:** Serializes and deserializes user data, including modules and user information, to and from a
  designated file.
- **Error Handling:** Captures and throws custom exceptions to signal file access or data integrity issues, facilitating
  robust error management in higher-level components.

**Implementation Details**

- **Initialization:** Verifies the presence of required directories/files or creates them. This is crucial for
  first-time application runs on a user's machine.

- **Saving Data:**
  The `saveModulesToFile` method serializes the current state of moduleList and user into a human-readable format (or a
  structured format like JSON/XML, depending on implementation) and writes it to a file. This method is invoked at
  critical points, such as application shutdown or after any operation that alters user data.

- **Loading Data:**
  The `loadDataFromFile` method reads the file contents, deserializes them back into the application's data structures (
  moduleList and user), and ensures that the application state reflects the persisted data. This method is typically
  called at application startup.

- **Data Integrity and Error Management:**
  Implements `try-catch` blocks to manage `IOExceptions` and custom exceptions, ensuring the application can handle and
  recover from unexpected issues during file operations.

  ### UML Diagram

  A simplified UML diagram for the Storage class and its interaction with the Module, User, and exception classes is
  shown below:
- ![View Storage Class](diagrams/Storage.png)

### Integration with FAP

The FAP class incorporates the Storage class to manage application data persistence. At startup, FAP calls
Storage.loadDataFromFile to restore the previous session's state. Before termination or at regular intervals, FAP
invokes Storage.saveModulesToFile to save the current state.

This integration ensures that the application's data lifecycle is managed efficiently, providing a seamless user
experience across sessions.

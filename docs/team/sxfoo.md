## Overview

Future Academic Planner (FAP) is a **robust academic management software** designed to help **streamline NUS Computer
Engineering (CEG) studentâ€™s academic journey at NUS**. If you can type fast, FAP can get your module planning done
faster than your traditional GUI app.

### Enhancements implemented

- Implemented `Parser` and `CommandMetadata` for parsing user inputs
- Implemented `View` command functionality and interface
- Implemented `Help` command functionality and interface
- Implemented `User` class


- **Enhancement:** `Parser` and `CommandMetadata` classes 
    - What it does: OOP implementation to parse user typed inputs to match a corresponding `Command` for FAP to execute,
    and also help to validate errors in what the user typed.
    - Justification: Allows future developers to add a new command easily within the FAP program


- **New Feature:** `View` command: View user's module plan
    - What it does: Allows users to see their module plan in a table format
    - Justification: Enhances user experience by allowing users to view what a certain module is about without leaving
      the application.
  

- **New Feature:** In-program `help` command
    - What it does: Show users the available commands and the syntax used within the program
    - Justification: A quick way for FAP users to know the available functionalities without referring back to the 
    user guide

### Contributions to the UG (User Guide)
- Set up `Content Navigation` for readers to jump to specified sections
- Written the section for commands regarding `set` command, `view` command, and `help` command

### Contributions to the DG (Developer Guide)
- Wrote `Parser` & `CommandMetadata` logic design and implementation
- Made the sequence diagram for `overall architecture`

### Contributions to team-based tasks, Review/mentoring contributions

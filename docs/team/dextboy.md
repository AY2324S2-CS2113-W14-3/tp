## Overview

**Future Academic Planner (FAP)** is a robust academic management software designed to streamline the academic journey 
for NUS Computer Engineering (CEG) students. Optimized for those who can type fast, FAP gets your module planning done 
faster than traditional GUI applications.

## New Features

### Implemented Core Classes:

- **`FAP.java`**:
  - Developed the main driver class which handles the flow of application execution from start to end.
  - Integrated all separate components of the software to work cohesively.

- **`Storage.java`**:
  - Engineered the storage handling which includes saving and loading user data from disk.
  - Ensured data integrity and implemented robust exception handling to prevent data corruption.

## Enhancements Implemented

### Exception Handling:

- **FAP Class**:
  - Implemented comprehensive exception handling within the FAP class to manage runtime errors effectively.

- **Storage Class**:
  - Introduced `StorageException` to handle specific I/O errors, enhancing the robustness of the storage operations.
  - Optimized error handling in the Storage class to gracefully manage exceptions and maintain system stability.

### Testing:

- **JUnit Tests**:
  - Developed JUnit tests for `FAP.java` to verify the integration and execution flows within the application.
  - Constructed JUnit tests for `Storage.java` focusing on file handling, data integrity, and exception scenarios.

## Developer Guide Contributions

### Documentation:

- **Architecture Design**:
  - Documented the overall architecture of the application, detailing the foundational design decisions and 
  interactions between various components.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - Elaborated on the implementation of `FAP.java`:
    - Explained the command processing mechanism and its interaction with other system components.
  - Detailed the functionality of `Storage.java`:
    - Described the data saving and loading processes, including how data integrity is maintained during these 
    operations.

### Diagrams:

- **Class Diagrams**:
  - Created class diagrams for `FAP.java` and `Storage.java` that outline the structural relationships and dependencies.

- **Sequence Diagrams**:
  - Developed sequence diagrams for `Storage.java` illustrating the process flows for saving and loading data, which 
  help in understanding the detailed operations and method calls.

## Contributions to Team-based Tasks

- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Implemented critical functionalities independently that formed the backbone of the application.

- **Collaboration**:
  - Worked closely with team members on integrating various components such as the Parser, Commands, and UI, 
  ensuring seamless functionality across the application.
  - Engaged in pair programming to mitigate bugs early and refine code efficiency.

## Review/Mentoring Contributions

- **Code Reviews**:
  - Actively reviewed pull requests to ensure code quality and functionality aligned with project standards.
  - Provided constructive feedback to peers, fostering a collaborative and learning-driven environment.

- **Mentoring**:
  - Assisted team members in understanding complex parts of the project, enhancing team competence and code quality.

## Contributions Beyond the Project Team

- **Bug Reporting and Resolutions**:
  - Identified and reported critical bugs in other teamsâ€™ projects during combined test sessions.
  - Contributed fixes to external bugs, aiding in the overall stability of peer projects.

## Additional Contributions

### README Page Creation

- **Overview**:
  - Authored the README page that serves as the front page of our GitHub project repository. This page provides project information, quick start details, and links to the User and Developer Guides which are essential for new users and potential contributors.
